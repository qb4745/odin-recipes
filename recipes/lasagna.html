    <h2>What Is a Funnel Cake?</h2>
    <p>
      Funnel cake is a popular dessert made by frying batter. Commonly served at
      carnivals and amusement parks, funnel cakes (as we know them today)
      originated in Pennsylvania in the late 1800s. The fried dessert is
      liberally sprinkled with powdered sugar before serving.
